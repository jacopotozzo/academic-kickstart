All of the exercises listed below refer to Ferraguto book (G. Ferraguto, Macroeconomics - Problems and Questions). 
As you know, since part of your program is based on the old-version of IS-LM and AD-AS model, I suggest you to get the exercises from previous versions of the book (up to version 3 should be ok). If you struggle to find the book send me an email.
